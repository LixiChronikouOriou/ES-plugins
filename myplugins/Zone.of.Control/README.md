**Problem**
In vanilla, tributing human space is a bit tedious because there are no mechanisms for making peace with the factions. The only systems which don't cause issues are the Pirates' ones. To tribute the Free Worlds one has to save-edit afterwards, for tributing Republic and Syndicate one has to use the phases during the main campaign to profit from the reputation reset afterwards. Independent systems like Men cause problems with neutral mission NPCs, so one has to save-edit here, too. Also the monastery planets New Tibet cannot be tributed in vanilla, causing ugly spots on the conquest map.

**Solution**
This post-campaign plugin solves this issue by providing a peace-making mechanism after tributing all systems of a faction, and by introducing polities for independent systems. Further, some planets will pay you tribute without a fight after the completion of a mission chain.
