# Inspired by the Starsector max level speedrun @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFu7PXKLCh0 using small phase ships with Reaper Torpedoes to demolish massive starbases.

# The name comes from thinking about the possibility of "space storms" allowing ships to hide inside them via getting cloaked by them, and searching online for something related to that, and inexplicably seeing the word wolf come up multiple times. Turns out Stormwolf is the name of something from Warhammer 40k, but yeah, that actually isn't what I got the name from, funnily enough. The boxy design is partly based on how I thought Starsector's Gremlin looked from the above video based on the way the phase units produce two rectangles when active, but turns out it's a bit more blobby. The design is probably also influenced by me associating the concepts of "wolf" & "space ship" with the Split Wolf from X-Tension; add a couple of large nacelles to the sides of it and that ship basically becomes this one, visually.

	description "A miraculous (or suspicious, depending on who you ask) triumph of open-access science; this is the first commercially available ship to utilize true full-spectrum cloaking technology. The system providing this capability is heavy and relies on a compact dipolar hull form, making the ship sluggish and unresponsive, and it interferes with the shield matrix. This interference does not lower the total shield energy, but does make it susceptible to hostile attempts at disruption or forced discharge. As if this weren't enough, the cloaking system is also highly prone to overheating during sustained operation."
	description "	The maintenance manual suggests a constant power draw of 300/s and a thermal load of 3000/s while cloaking is engaged, and considering an upgrade to a helium-based coolant system for peace-of-mind operation. Uninstallation of the ramscoops is also advised against."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Stormwolf's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."
