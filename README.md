# ES Plugin Republications #

This repository aims at the republication of older plugins by various authors which need some kind of overhaul, as vanilla ES has continued its development and some things just don't fit anymore. Just think of the 0.10.7 ship and engines rebalancing.

LixiChronikouOriou, aka Timeout on Discord, is *not* the author of these plugins, just their editor.

### Bunsen Burner ###



**Author: [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry)**



An overhaul and re-publication of [Flamethrower-Turret-1.1.0](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/endless-sky-flamethrower-turret). Since the last update of the plugin in January 2021 the Flamethrower was nerfed and got a new outfit image, so the Flamethrower Turret didn't fit anymore to the vanilla Flamethrower.



Therefore, N.Barry's turret was combined with the old vanilla Flamethrower image it was based on to create a next-generation Flamethrower which burns hotter -- the Bunsen Burner. Now with *blue* flames. Naturally, as we are used to, one has to complete Barmy's weapon test mission, written by N.Barry, to unlock it.





**Changelog**



2025-04-28: v.1.0.0

Overhaul and Re-publication as Bunsen Burner.



2021-01-26: -

Last Update of the Flamethrower Turret plugin.

### Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ###



**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**



An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.



Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design.



**Changelog**



2025-04-27: v.1.0.1

Fixes considering stand-alonization.



2025-04-27: v.1.0.0

Overhaul and Re-publication as Louise Conglomerate Shipyards.



2020-05-31: -

Last Update of the More Ships Plugin.
