	description "This laser injects fuel into the center of an annular beam, confining most of the rapidly heated and expanding hydrogen plasma within. It works by an action comparable to that of a plasma cutter but with a much greater range, quickly drilling through solid matter. After ignition, a small portion of the heated plasma is redirected back to pump the laser, allowing it to sustain firing with relatively little additional energy input, making it suitable for civilian ships without nuclear power plants."
	description "	While Pickerberry designed their mining laser for large ships, its partially modular design, based on standardized and widely available components, makes it easy to remove from its turret mounting."
