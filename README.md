# ES Plugin Re-publications #

This repository aims at the re-publication of older plugins by various authors which need some kind of overhaul, as vanilla ES has continued its development and some things just don't fit anymore. Just think of the 0.10.7 ship and engines rebalancing.

LixiChronikouOriou, aka Timeout on Discord, is *not* the author of these plugins, just their editor.

### Bunsen Burner ###

**Author: [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry)**

An overhaul and re-publication of [Flamethrower-Turret-1.1.0](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/endless-sky-flamethrower-turret). Since the last update of the plugin in January 2021 the Flamethrower was nerfed and got a new outfit image, so the Flamethrower Turret didn't fit anymore to the vanilla Flamethrower.

Therefore, N.Barry's turret was combined with the old vanilla Flamethrower image it was based on to create a next-generation Flamethrower which burns hotter -- the Bunsen Burner. Now with *blue* flames. Naturally, as we are used to, one has to complete Barmy's weapon test mission, written by N.Barry, to unlock it.

### Korunak Defense Drones ###

**Author: [Starmlerp](https://github.com/starmlerp)**

**Artwork: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer), [Becca](https://github.com/beccabunny)**

An overhaul and republication of the [Defense Drone Plugin](https://github.com/starmlerp/ESDefenseDronePlugin), with consideration of the corresponding ES PRs [#5071](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5071) and [#5417](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5417).

Being distributed over a plugin and two PRs from May to October 2020, Starmlerp's idea has never been  consolidated into a whole. Nevertheless there's even a serious modern plugin, [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) which takes the original plugin into account. It was time to modernize the stats, bring everything together, and round off.

Korunak Robotics is a sister company of Korunak Photovoltaics. Except of houshold drones of any kind like the Vroomba or the Sheepomotion, it also became well-known for its space combat drones. Popular among merchants, the [classified] became interested to [paragraph classified]. Therefore, [2 pages classified], so finally [10 pages classified].

The basic *Defense Drone* is available from the beginning, the *Nock* in-war, the *Super Nock* post-war. Further, the plugin brings a drone-carrying modification of the Freighter and involves [classified].

### Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ###

**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**

An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.

Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design.
