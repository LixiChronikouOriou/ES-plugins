	description "A high-power directional LIDAR connected to a microseismic analyzer. Provides audio-visual feedback on the density of valuable minerals in a wide area, allowing for rapid surveying and evaluation of a star system's overall richness. Multiple installed scanners will pulse in sync, improving the resolution of readings. The emitted waves cannot penetrate asteroids very well, so repeat readings may be necessary to accurately assess very dense fields."
	description "	At very close ranges the microseismic analyzer alone can automatically determine the composition of asteroids, and even estimate the cargo contents of ships based on their internal mass distribution."
	description "	The LIDAR is also capable of blinding missiles that rely on optical tracking, giving the outfit some defensive utility that can be especially valuable to heavy ships that are often subject to torpedo attacks."
