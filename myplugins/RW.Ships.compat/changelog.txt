v1.01
- New ship: Packet Liner

v1.02
- New ship: Thunderer. A high-speed ship good for a lot of things since it's basically a medium warship with the weapon and engine capacities swapped. Weapon selection is limited by being turret-only, but watch out for the pirate gatling variant!
- Added an Auxiliary-style variant (i.e. one with its own graphics and different base stats) of the Cargo Drone that replaces its containers with with fuel tanks. Currently its usefulness is rather limited by the fact that it can't be made to refuel your other ships (at least as far as I know), only undock/redock to restock its own carrier, and you can't decide what ships carry what drones (again as far as I know) so there's no guarantee that your fuel drones will be distributed evenly and be able to refuel all your ships. Handy for the player to have one to refuel while exploring, at least, or do something funny like have afterburner-only propulsion.
- Added an Auxiliary-style variant of the Mudrock with its containers removed and replaced with 12(!) extra drone bays. A semi-easter-egg that can't be purchased, but appears as a rare spawn among human miners so it can be captured.
- Improved Packet Liner bunks (63→73) & drag (7.85→7.8).*
- Improved Mudrock drag (17.8→15.8).*
- Reduced Gemstone fuel further (600→500→400).*
- Reduced Cargo Drone death explosion amount to match vanilla ships of its scale.
- Adjusted Deepvale description (reference to proper-noun "Mining Drones" into generic "drones") and model details (bridge windows, dorsal turret mount size, engine symmetry).
- Added Gemstone variants, along with Mining Drone variants to go with it, mainly used by pirates. The torpedo one's pretty cool since the drones will actually dock to re-arm; not sure this is a feature seen on any vanilla fighters/drones since they generally have energy-based guns installed as well.
- Re-rendered Gemstone with SSAO and made its lower section larger to be a bit more indicative of its stats and how much it slows down when it's full (it should be like a pelican with a full beak); could use more work though.
- Added reverse engine effects to Gemstone and adjusted same effects of Mudrock to match the outward shutter-vents style of the newly-added Thunderer.*
- Fixed Mudrock model shading toward rear end (Deepvale had the same issue before).
- Fleet adjustments; mainly Deepvale & Mudrock less common in the Core region.
- Ships are now sold by their own shipyard, Pickerberry, based on New Britain (Dabih system). They're available in most of the same locations as before – predominantly in the North, South, and near Earth. New shipyards on the industrialized planets of Longjump (Sabik system), Solace (Pherkad system), and New China (Merak system). Their attached outfitters offer a little more dispersed access to ramscoops and large fuel cells (the latter's descriptions imply they should be common on civilian ships, but they're not actually).
* Will only affect newly-acquired ships unless you directly edit your owned ship(s) in your save file.

v1.03
- New ship: Cavalier. A heavy gunboat with a 5/2 gun/turret hardpoint layout and a low-drag armored hull. Middling engine capacity and poor heat dissipation make it a little clunky, but like the Raven it is undeniably capable of punching above its weight.

v1.04
- New ship: Lancier torpedo boat.

v1.05
- Updated mass/drag/heat dissipation values for game version 0.10.7.

v1.06
- New plugin icon.
- New mass/drag/heat dissipation values finalized for game version 0.10.8.
- Cavalier & Cargo/Fuel Drone heat dissipations have been reduced disproportionately further than other ships (i.e. nerfed) along the way. For the drone this is slight and basically irrelevent, but it is quite significant for the Cavalier.
- Lancier gun slots intended for missiles made parallel.
- Mudrock death explosion blast/damage/force increased (110→140).
- New ship: Everest. A massive and well-armed super-freighter with enough capacity to be a human equivalent to the Deep River. Has the "bulk bay" attribute for compatibility with some jobs in the Mega Freight plugin, and appears in its own variants of the vanilla food convoy escort job.

v1.07
- New ship: Stormwolf, an attempt at a balanced cloak-capable human warship! The cloaking is built-in, of course, and it's a sluggish ship that is prone to overheating and disruption to its shield matrix.
- New variants of the Thunderer flown by NPCs: Prisoner Transport, Blockade Runner.
- Minor Packet Liner & Lancier description changes.
- Lancier hull cost increased (1.9M→2.2M).
- Lancier fleet spawns that previously used the stock variant, and aren't part of attacks on specific targets (missions & "pirate raid" fleet), now use a variant that carries "only" 36 torpeodes (1.5 pod bursts) instead of the full 84 (3.5 pod bursts).
- Cavalier (Meteor) variant given missing weapons.
- Cavalier fleet spawns adjusted: Pairs of Cavaliers were moved from the small to the large pirate fleets, making them less common. The Cavlier (Bomber) pair was removed entirely from northern pirates and replaced with a single Cavalier (Particle) in the small fleet. The less common of the two small northern/southern merchant spawns are more lightly guarded by a single Cavalier (Particle) instead of two, but the freighters themselves are variants instead of stock, and the southern versions now use an Argosy instead of a Freighter.
- Remodelled the Gemstone to use the same semi-external drone bay type as the Deepvale. The positions of the drone bays and reverse engines have been changed slightly, so any existing Gemstones in saves will have them somewhat out-of-place on the new sprite.
- Added limited firing arcs to Deepvale side/bay turrets, since it has so many. This is unlikely to be done for other ships even where it makes sense, unless the Arc-Over plugin becomes stock, as they weren't designed/balanced with limited arcs in mind.
- Sunracer shipyards: Pickerberry Basics+Luxury → Drones+Luxury.
- Reunion shipyards: Pickerberry Basics+Luxury → Drones+Historic+Luxury
- New Tortuga shipyards: Pickerberry Pirates → Drones+Pirates.
- Added bounty hunting jobs targetting pirate Cavaliers & Thunderers.
- Added larger merchant convoy hunting jobs involving working alongside pirate Lanciers.
- Added a pirate Lancier escort job with a special payload.
- Optimized graphic file sizes as much as possible (previously used FileOptimizer running only some of its plugins in the fastest mode, but now all of them in the slowest mode).

v1.08
- Added a pair of on-theme outfits:
- Pickerberry Mining Laser (Turret), a fuel-augmented heavy mining laser. Its range of 350 is a significant step-up from the vanilla Mining Laser, and its fuel consumption supplies some of the power demand, making it suitable for slow civilian ships without nuclear power plants. You will want a ramscoop, though. Note that this weapon can't fire automatically when installed on your flagship since that functionality seems to be disabled for fuel-consuming weapons.
- LIDAR scanners as secondary "weapons" that utilize [no ship collisions] & [no asteroid collisions] to let you ping minable asteroids anywhere within radar range. Thanks to Daeridanii for the inspiration with the Antiproton Emitter in Successors Extras (which applies a similar concept to detect cloaked ships), Nyx for one of the sound effect recordings, and to whoever decided to make [no asteroid collisions] & [no minable collisions] separate attributes.

v1.09
- New outfit: Pickerberry Ramscoop: an 'active' ramscoop that consumes power to boost its collection rate. It also produces a moderate amount of both constant waste heat from operation of the heavy magnozzle and solar heat from increases in the pressure of plasma confined by it. It will eventually be made redundant by the development of the Catalytic Ramscoop, but it is available without requirements and remains relatively cheap.
- New different-model variant: Modified Stormwolf, featuring two extra guns, an extra turret mount, and faster cloak time (3s to the original's 4s). It's not available for purchase but it may come to you after you establish a name for yourself.
- Stormwolf required crew 18→14, bunks 28→22. I wanted it to have a relatively large engineering department and consequent salary cost for maintaining its cloaking device, but feel having a Frigate-sized crew is a bit much for the design visual in visual terms (it's essentially meant to be one of the absolute largest ship models with a cockpit instead of a bridge). The crew requirement is still quite high considering it's on the low/small end among medium warships. The modified variant of the ship has a slightly larger crew/bunk space closer to the original values.
- Stormwolf drag 9.5→9.3, based on a calculation intended to give it a non-arbitrary value that is slightly lower.
- Added shipyard delivery jobs for Pickerberry. These are of the same type as Tarazed et.al., though there are also cargo/passenger combo jobs that are more specific to their circumstances.
- Reduced Everest, Deepvale, and Mudrock drag in-line with other large human freighters in v0.10.11.
- Pickerberry Omnidirectional Scanner mass & outfit space 36→18 (weapon space 24→12). Now matches its increase in passive scanning stats over the directional scanner, and the general mass difference between gun-slot & turret-slot outfits.
- Added @3x versions of scanner sound effects.
