<blockquote>ï»¿## Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ##



**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**



An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.



Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design.



**Changelog**



2025-04-27: v.1.0.0

Overhaul and Republication as Louise Conglomerate Shipyards.



2020-05-31: -
