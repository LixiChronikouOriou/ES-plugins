# ES Plugin Re-publications #

This repository aims at the re-publication of older plugins by various authors which need some kind of overhaul, as vanilla ES has continued its development and some things just don't fit anymore. Just think of the 0.10.7 ship and engines rebalancing.

LixiChronikouOriou, aka Timeout on Discord, is *not* the author of these plugins, just their editor.

But first lets begin with a short...
<details>
<summary>:blue_book: <b>Plugin Recommendation List</b></summary>

This is a set of plugins which I <i>personally</i> regard to be my <i>base</i> setup. They're more or less close to vanilla, and are rounded-off, i.e. new ships and outfits have their own images. Some of them provide basic QoL. However, there's much more interesting stuff out there for any taste, notably the works of <a href='https://github.com/AvianGeneticist'>AvianGeneticist</a>, things barely someone has thought of and testing out the borders of ES's mechanics.<br><br>Consult the <a href='https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html'>ES Plugin List</a>, Hecter's <a href='https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive'>ES Plugin Archive</a>, and the <a href='https://discord.com/channels/251118043411775489/1208535517759807519'>Discord Plugin Release Channel</a> for more.

### Bunsen Burner ###

**Author: [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry)**

An overhaul and re-publication of [Flamethrower-Turret-1.1.0](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/endless-sky-flamethrower-turret). Since the last update of the plugin in January 2021 the Flamethrower was nerfed and got a new outfit image, so the Flamethrower Turret didn't fit anymore to the vanilla Flamethrower.

Therefore, N.Barry's turret was combined with the old vanilla Flamethrower image it was based on to create a next-generation Flamethrower which burns hotter -- the Bunsen Burner. Now with *blue* flames. Naturally, as we are used to, one has to complete Barmy's weapon test mission, written by N.Barry, to unlock it.

Also Darcy Manoel's H2H flamethrower, which is based on the same design, was added as the Bunsen Torch. Available during the war, it will be banned afterwards as inhumane and only be obtainable on Pirate-ruled planets. However, legally bought torches still won't be fined because of exception rules in the corresponding paragraphs.

The original concept for FOE's Shipwright Gear was introduced by Darcy Manoel and  [Hurleveur](https://github.com/Hurleveur) with the Shipwright Gear in [Fluff](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/res/mds/ships.md#fluff) resp. the Repair Team in [Unfettered Innovations](https://github.com/Hurleveur/unfettered-innovations). The stats are a mix-up inspired from those. The concept was extended by toolset-slots and evolved into the Hesperian Toolbox.

__Note__: Overwrites the vanilla Heavy Blaster. Justified, as the vanilla HB's lore is imho heretic to the original by 1010todd.

### Jaws ###

**Author: [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

**Artwork: [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae-assets)**

**Thanks**: Zuckung

Adds the Antaren Thresher to Gossamer and neighboring systems, which consumes void fish, asteroids and since recently also Abberants. Once inhabited also Arachi space and even Antares, but out of unknown reasons went extinct there long ago.

Completely harmless.

Inspired by the Spaceshark from [Mil-taj Protectorate](https://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate) by [Demolish238](https://github.com/demolish238), which was derived from the Antaren Thresher in [Cosmic Canidae](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae) by [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io).

Can be found in Omnis under the Vyrmeids.

In the Thresher's habitat you can find crunched, i.e. derelict, Aberrants with otherwise extremely rare items to plunder.

### Korunak Defense Drones ###

**Author: [Starmlerp](https://github.com/starmlerp)**

**Artwork: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer), [Becca](https://github.com/beccabunny)**

**Thanks**: Kitteh

An overhaul and republication of the [Defense Drone Plugin](https://github.com/starmlerp/ESDefenseDronePlugin), with consideration of the corresponding ES PRs [#5071](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5071) and [#5417](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5417).

Being distributed over a plugin and two PRs from May to October 2020, Starmlerp's idea has never been  consolidated into a whole. Nevertheless there's even a serious modern plugin, [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) which takes the original plugin into account. It was time to modernize the stats, bring everything together, and round off.

Korunak Robotics is a sister company of Korunak Photovoltaics. Except of houshold drones of any kind like the Vroomba or the Sheepomotion, it also became well-known for its space combat drones. Popular among merchants, the [classified] became interested to [paragraph classified]. Therefore, [2 pages classified], so finally [10 pages classified].

The basic *Defense Drone* is available from the beginning, the *Nock* in-war, the *Super Nock* post-war. Further, the plugin brings a drone-carrying modification of the Freighter and involves [classified].

**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**

**Requires**: [Fundamental.Outfit.Expansion](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou/ES-plugins/blob/main/README.md#FundamentalOutfitExpansion)

**Thanks**: Kitteh, Corvettefan

An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.

Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design. Preferred shipyard of the Space Hansa, which despises Pirates, and has no trust at all in the ability of any government to solve this long-lasting issue.

Yeer e Ki Cooperative Shipyards reached out to the Louise Conglomerate, and signed a contract for a licensed production of 3 ship models on Makerplace, equipped with Hai technology, in an ambitious advance to mess up business of Imo Loo Meer Corporation and the Mon Ki i'Hiya Consortium.

### Solar Sails ###

**Author: [TheronEpic](https://github.com/TheronEpic)**

**Thanks:** Kitteh

An overhaul and re-publication of TheronEpic's [Solar Sails](https://github.com/TheronEpic/theronepic-solar-sails). Since the last update of the plugin in October 2020 there have been made massive changes in ES considering engines, so a stat overhaul was overdue. Also various syntax bugs had to be hunted down.

It seems, that TheronEpic could not complete the work on this plugin, so future updates of this re-publication will fill some gaps, e.g. considering fleets and variants.

One major change made, proposed by **Kitteh**, was to switch from reflective to diffractive solar sails. Therefore the sails, besides providing thrust and turn, also generate energy. However, reverse thrust as introduced by the original, was removed because of a lack of explainability.

**Changelog**

| Date | Version | Comment |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2025-07-19 | 2.0.2 | Fixes. |
| 2025-06-12 | 2.0.1 | Added series and index specifications. Removed unused files. Changed icon. |
| 2025-06-01 | 2.0.0 | Complete rework -- Made the solar sails to be diffractive, i.e. added solar collection. Buffed relation of turn/thrust to used engine/outfit space, change from turn/thrust heat to solar heat, and removed reverse thrust. Also removed front sail variants, and KP-3 and KPM-6 panels. Added @2x images. Removed experimental status. |
| 2025-05-18 | 1.0.0 | Overhaul and Re-publication. |
| 2020-10-30 | - | Last Update of the original *Solar Sails* plugin. |

>Provides a proper way to tribute human space after finishing the main plot without needing to save-edit (Free Worlds) or being dependent on time slots during campaign (Republic & Syndicate). Also handles independent systems by defining own polities to avoid issues with independent mission NPCs. And adds some vanilla mission chain related candy.


<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>

### Zone of Control ###

**Author: [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

#### Introduction ####
In vanilla, tributing human space is a bit tedious because there are no mechanisms for making peace with the factions. The only systems which don't cause issues are the Pirates' ones. To tribute the Free Worlds one has to save-edit afterwards, for tributing Republic and Syndicate one has to use the phases during the main campaign to profit from the reputation reset afterwards. Independent systems like Men cause problems with neutral mission NPCs, so one has to save-edit here, too. Also the monastery planets New Tibet cannot be tributed in vanilla, causing ugly spots on the conquest map.

#### Features ####
This post-campaign plugin solves this issue by providing a peace-making mechanism after tributing all systems of a faction, and by introducing polities for independent systems. Further, some planets will pay you tribute without a fight after the completion of a mission chain. Also New Tibet and Harmony will pay symbolic tribute of 1 credit to color the map.
