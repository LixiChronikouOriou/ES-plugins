# ES Plugin Re-publications #

This repository aims at the re-publication of older plugins by various authors which need some kind of overhaul, as vanilla ES has continued its development and some things just don't fit anymore. Just think of the 0.10.7 ship and engines rebalancing.

LixiChronikouOriou, aka Timeout on Discord, is *not* the author of these plugins, just their editor.

But first lets begin with a short...
<details>
<summary>:blue_book: <b>Plugin Recommendation List</b></summary>

This is a set of plugins which I <i>personally</i> regard to be my <i>base</i> setup. They're more or less close to vanilla, and are rounded-off, i.e. new ships and outfits have their own images. Some of them provide basic QoL. However, there's much more interesting stuff out there for any taste, notably the works of <a href='https://github.com/AvianGeneticist'>AvianGeneticist</a>, things barely someone has thought of and testing out the borders of ES's mechanics.<br><br>Consult the <a href='https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html'>ES Plugin List</a>, Hecter's <a href='https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive'>ES Plugin Archive</a>, and the <a href='https://discord.com/channels/251118043411775489/1208535517759807519'>Discord Plugin Release Channel</a> for more.

>Next-generation Flamethrower, as gun, turret and h2h. For those who like it hot.


<details>

### Bunsen Burner ###

**Author: [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry)**

An overhaul and re-publication of [Flamethrower-Turret-1.1.0](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/endless-sky-flamethrower-turret). Since the last update of the plugin in January 2021 the Flamethrower was nerfed and got a new outfit image, so the Flamethrower Turret didn't fit anymore to the vanilla Flamethrower.

Therefore, N.Barry's turret was combined with the old vanilla Flamethrower image it was based on to create a next-generation Flamethrower which burns hotter -- the Bunsen Burner. Now with *blue* flames. Naturally, as we are used to, one has to complete Barmy's weapon test mission, written by N.Barry, to unlock it.

Also Darcy Manoel's H2H flamethrower, which is based on the same design, was added as the Bunsen Torch. Available during the war, it will be banned afterwards as inhumane and only be obtainable on Pirate-ruled planets. However, legally bought torches still won't be fined because of exception rules in the corresponding paragraphs.

**Changelog**

>Adds Factory Outlet Stations around the HQ planets of shipyard companies, where basically only ship hulls (with just few essential outfits) are sold, such reducing the price significantly.


<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>

### Factory Outlets ###

**Author: [Lifeyouristhis](https://github.com/lifeyouristhis), [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

**Thanks**: Zuckung

Ship price = hull + outfit prices. This simple equation has the consequence that ships can be overprized when one intends to replace most of the outfits anyway, and one would basically need only the hull.

Based on an idea of [Lifeyouristhis](https://github.com/lifeyouristhis), this plugin introduces *Factory Outlets*. Around the headquarter planets of the shipyard companies stations have been placed which sell their ships with only a minimum sets of outfits, just enough to let a ship fly. For instance, a Leviathan's standard price is 17.1 Mio credits, but at the Betelgeuse Factory Outlet station it's only 9.9 Mio.

No factory outlet for Navy ships, because lore. No factory outlet ship variants for fighter and drones, because senseless.

Currently the plugins [DAIS](https://github.com/Daeridanii1/DAIS), [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) and [Louise Conglomerate Shipyards](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou/ES-plugins/blob/main/README.md#LouiseConglomerateShipyards) are supported. More are intended.

### Fundamental Outfit Expansion ###

**Authors:** see table

**Thanks for feedback and discussions:** AvianGeneticist, Cend, Kassandra Haruki, Keilaph, Kitteh, Questenberg, Unknown_Rawrs

**Notes**
- Other fundamental content can be found in the plugin recommendation list, especially see [Rumskib](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/rumskib) for Plasma Turrets (Single, Quad) and Gatling Turrets (Single, Triple, Quad).
- Overwrites the vanilla Heavy Blaster. Justified, as the vanilla HB's lore is imho heretic to the original by 1010todd.
- Contains the ES-wide only adaptive reactor -- Synatom's Sentinel Reactor.
- The original concept for FOE's Shipwright Gear was introduced by Darcy Manoel and  [Hurleveur](https://github.com/Hurleveur) with the Shipwright Gear in [Fluff](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/res/mds/ships.md#fluff) resp. the Repair Team in [Unfettered Innovations](https://github.com/Hurleveur/unfettered-innovations). The stats are a mix-up inspired from those. The concept was extended by toolset-slots and evolved into the Hesperian Toolbox.

**Artwork: [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae-assets)**

**Thanks**: Zuckung

Adds the Antaren Thresher to Gossamer and neighboring systems, which consumes void fish, asteroids and since recently also Abberants. Once inhabited also Arachi space and even Antares, but out of unknown reasons went extinct there long ago.

Completely harmless.

Inspired by the Spaceshark from [Mil-taj Protectorate](https://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate) by [Demolish238](https://github.com/demolish238), which was derived from the Antaren Thresher in [Cosmic Canidae](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae) by [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io).

Can be found in Omnis under the Vyrmeids.

In the Thresher's habitat you can find crunched, i.e. derelict, Aberrants with otherwise extremely rare items to plunder.

**Changelog**

### Korunak Defense Drones ###

**Author: [Starmlerp](https://github.com/starmlerp)**

**Artwork: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer), [Becca](https://github.com/beccabunny)**

**Thanks**: Kitteh

An overhaul and republication of the [Defense Drone Plugin](https://github.com/starmlerp/ESDefenseDronePlugin), with consideration of the corresponding ES PRs [#5071](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5071) and [#5417](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5417).

Being distributed over a plugin and two PRs from May to October 2020, Starmlerp's idea has never been  consolidated into a whole. Nevertheless there's even a serious modern plugin, [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) which takes the original plugin into account. It was time to modernize the stats, bring everything together, and round off.

Korunak Robotics is a sister company of Korunak Photovoltaics. Except of houshold drones of any kind like the Vroomba or the Sheepomotion, it also became well-known for its space combat drones. Popular among merchants, the [classified] became interested to [paragraph classified]. Therefore, [2 pages classified], so finally [10 pages classified].

The basic *Defense Drone* is available from the beginning, the *Nock* in-war, the *Super Nock* post-war. Further, the plugin brings a drone-carrying modification of the Freighter and involves [classified].

### Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ###

**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**

**Requires**: [Fundamental.Outfit.Expansion](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou/ES-plugins/blob/main/README.md#FundamentalOutfitExpansion)

**Thanks**: Kitteh, Corvettefan

An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.

Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design. Preferred shipyard of the Space Hansa, which despises Pirates, and has no trust at all in the ability of any government to solve this long-lasting issue.

Yeer e Ki Cooperative Shipyards reached out to the Louise Conglomerate, and signed a contract for a licensed production of 3 ship models on Makerplace, equipped with Hai technology, in an ambitious advance to mess up business of Imo Loo Meer Corporation and the Mon Ki i'Hiya Consortium.

### Solar Sails ###

**Author: [TheronEpic](https://github.com/TheronEpic)**

**Thanks:** Kitteh

An overhaul and re-publication of TheronEpic's [Solar Sails](https://github.com/TheronEpic/theronepic-solar-sails). Since the last update of the plugin in October 2020 there have been made massive changes in ES considering engines, so a stat overhaul was overdue. Also various syntax bugs had to be hunted down, and some gaps have been filled, e.g. considering variants, as seemingly TheronEpic could not complete the work on this plugin.

One major change made, proposed by **Kitteh**, was to switch from reflective to diffractive solar sails. Therefore the sails, besides providing thrust and turn, also generate energy. However, reverse thrust as introduced by the original, was removed because of a lack of explainability.

This plugins replaces the sales of Shuttle, Heavy Shuttle, Bounder, Arrow, Hogshead, Star Queen, Star Barge, Freighter and Sunder with sail variants, superior to the vanilla versions. Also removes the shipyard "Basic Ships" from every planet with "Betelgeuse Basics" and/or "Syndicate Basics" shipyards.

>Provides a proper way to tribute human space after finishing the main plot without needing to save-edit (Free Worlds) or being dependent on time slots during campaign (Republic & Syndicate). Also handles independent systems by defining own polities to avoid issues with independent mission NPCs. And adds some vanilla mission chain related candy.

### Zone of Control ###

**Author: [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

#### Introduction ####
In vanilla, tributing human space is a bit tedious because there are no mechanisms for making peace with the factions. The only systems which don't cause issues are the Pirates' ones. To tribute the Free Worlds one has to save-edit afterwards, for tributing Republic and Syndicate one has to use the phases during the main campaign to profit from the reputation reset afterwards. Independent systems like Men cause problems with neutral mission NPCs, so one has to save-edit here, too. Also the monastery planets New Tibet and Harmony cannot be tributed in vanilla, causing ugly spots on the conquest map.

#### Features ####
This post-campaign plugin solves this issue by providing a peace-making mechanism after tributing all systems of a faction, and by introducing polities for independent systems. Further, some planets will pay you tribute without a fight after the completion of a mission chain. Also New Tibet and Harmony will pay symbolic tribute of 1 credit to color the map. Deneb will fall to you after having conquered Republic, Syndicate and Free Worlds.

Has individual dialogue boxes for each of the following situations.

| Faction | Requires | Results |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Free Worlds | Main plot complete. All FW systems except Alioth and Girtab dominated. | Recovered reputation for FW and Militia. Revoked militia license will be restored. New Tibet (Alioth) and Harmony (Girtab) will pay symbolic tribute (1 credit) to color the map properly. |
| Republic | Main plot complete. All Republican systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Republic, Deep Security and Militia. Revoked navy licenses will **not** be restored. |
| Syndicate | Main plot complete. All Syndicate systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Syndicate. |
| Free State <sup>1</sup> | Main plot complete. All Free State systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Free State and Militia. |
| Commonwealth<sup>2</sup> | Main plot complete. All Commonwealth systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Commonwealth and Militia. |

1) A new polity for the independent system of Men. Includes Antares, if it remains neutral after the campaign.
2) A new polity, emerging if the system Tarazed has not joined the Free Worlds during the campaign. Includes also the inhabited systems Dabih and Albireo.

| Planet | Requires | Results |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Haven | 90 days after "Ice Queen 8: done", and Haven isn't tributed currently. | Haven dominated. |
| Norn | 90 days after "Stone to Hope: Thanks: offered", and Norn isn't tributed currently. | Norn dominated. |
| Poisonwood | 30 days after "event: liberation of Poisonwood" (and done it the proper way) and "main plot completed", and Poisonwood isn't tributed currently. | Poisonwood dominated. |
| Pugglemug<br>Pugglequat | Has tributed all of Republic, Syndicate and Free Worlds | Both planets of the Deneb system are dominated. |
| Windblain | 30 days after "Hjlod Remembers Windblain: done", and Windblain isn't tributed currently. | Windblain dominated. |
