	description "These colossal and heavily defended bulk freighters epitomize the recent golden century of commerce under the Republic. They are responsible for moving the majority of the food tonnage from the Dirt Belt to the populous Paradise Planets, but their size and minimal gearing make them wholly unsuitable for trading away from the arterial routes and major spaceports."
