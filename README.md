# ES Plugin Republications #

This repository aims at the republication of older plugins by various authors which need some kind of overhaul, as vanilla ES has continued its development and some things just don't fit anymore. Just think of the 0.10.7 ship and engines rebalancing.

LixiChronikouOriou, aka Timeout on Discord, is *not* the author of these plugins, just their editor.

### Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ###



**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**



An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.



Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design.



**Changelog**



2025-04-27: v.1.0.0

Overhaul and Republication as Louise Conglomerate Shipyards.



2020-05-31: -

Last Update of the More Ships Plugin.
